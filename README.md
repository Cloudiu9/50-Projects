# 50 Projects in 50 Days – HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This repository contains my progress through the **50 Projects in 50 Days** course by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop. The goal of this challenge is to build a new mini frontend project each day using vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with a strong focus on hands-on practice and mastering core web fundamentals.

## 🔍 Structure

Each folder contains:
- ✅ The **project files** (HTML, CSS, JS)
- 🧠 My **personal notes** on key takeaways, concepts, or code explanations

The projects are built without frameworks or libraries, just raw frontend code, to build fluency with DOM manipulation, CSS transitions/animations, and JavaScript logic.

## 🧱 Skills Practiced

- Flexbox & Grid layout
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Responsive design
- CSS transitions & animations
- JavaScript fundamentals (ES6+)
- Local storage & simple state
- Clean, modular code structure

## 🚧 My Goal

To strengthen my frontend development skills through deliberate, daily practice—building visual intuition and muscle memory. This project also serves as a portfolio of work that reflects my progression and learning process.

## 📈 Progress

I will update this repo as I complete more projects, along with notes where applicable.
